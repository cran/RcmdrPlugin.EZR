Changes to Version 1.24

  o Added likelihood ratio test after logistic regression analysis.

Changes to Version 1.23

  o Added functions to output summary tables.

Changes to Version 1.22

  o Small bug fixes.

Changes to Version 1.21

  o Added generalized Welch test.

  o Small bug fixes.

Changes to Version 1.20

  o Changed dialogue design and added apply button for Rcmdr ver 2.0-0.

  o Changed the method to set the breakpoints between histogram cells from "Sturges" to "Scott". Made a new function, hist2(), to fix a bug of hist().

  o Changed the scripts to draw cumulative incidece function from using "etype" option to using "mstate" option, and at the same time, updated stackcuminc() for "Stacked cumulative incidences" for compatability with new version (2.37-2) of "survival" package.
